# Q2.
# There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square. It takes one integer and
# returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five
# squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with *.

xyz = 5

def square(num):
    return num**2

squared = square(xyz)
print(squared)
