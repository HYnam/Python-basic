# Write a program that uses the turtle module and a for loop to draw something. It doesnâ€™t have to be
# complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing
# something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting .speed(10) for the
# turtle to draw fast, or .speed(0) for it to draw super fast with no animation.)

import turtle
# setup the drawing environment
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

# the following repeats 4 times
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
